Project 1- The startup

## Why do we do this
Projects are important in the mission to becoming a web developer, as opportunities to apply for web developer roles. One of the requirements is high-quality deployed examples of your work to feature in your portfolio. This shows employers what you can do and the role you play when working on projects

## What's it for

This project will be a centerpiece for your portfolio and your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. One of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio.
