# Who's on First
Project 1- The startup

## Why do we do this
Projects are important in the mission to becoming a web developer, as opportunities to apply for web developer roles. One of the requirements is high-quality deployed examples of your work to feature in your portfolio. This shows employers what you can do and the role you play when working on projects

## What's it for

This project, as an example of our skills and knowledge, showcases CSS framework, and interactiveness, using two server-side APIs (weather and event). The creators made an event tracker that allows weather to be observed while viewing, with JavaScript functional and object-oriented programming often used due to its efficiency as you will see viewing the code and the deployed project.
